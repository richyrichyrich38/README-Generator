## Description

A key component of your profile, and one that many new developers overlook, is the README file that's associated with each repository. A README file acts like a virtual storefront to a repositoryâ€”it's the first thing that a person sees when they visit a repo on GitHub. But it's also much more than that: README files contain essential information about the repo's project. Thus, the quality of a README file can differentiate a high-quality repo from a low-quality one.

## Installation 

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

## Contributing 

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests 

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
